							<p>We decided to make a chessboard. We wanted to be able to play single player chess against
								a computer as if it were a human. This meant having a physical chessboard
								(as opposed to a virtual one) and integrating a way for the computer to
								detect the state of the board and physically move its own pieces.

					<h2>System</h2>
					<p></p>
				</header>
				<p>Our project consists of several integrated systems: a 2D gantry
					that moves an electromagnet underneath the board, a set of 3D-printed
					chess pieces with magnets on the bottom, the chess board itself,
					and a chess AI capable of using computer vision to detect its pieces on the board and
					using the electromagnet and gantry to move them.

					We focused on visual design as well as functionality, and this took the form of an
					arcade-inspired color theme and lights.</p>

					<h2>Project Origins</h2>
					<p>
					</p>
				</header>
				<p>We were inspired by the Harry Potter-style Wizard's Chess team from POE 2014 and
					decided to iterate on their project. We loved their hidden electromagnet that made the chess pieces
					move on their own, but wanted to take a different approach on the theme.

					Instead of implementing voice control for the pieces, our software team was more
					interested in developing a computer vision system to recognize the pieces on the board.
					This allowed the human to simply move their pieces and the computer to react appropriately.

							<p>Arla's an Engineering: Design major interested in Mechanical Design, and helped to fill the shoes of a
								mechanical engineer for this project. She focused primarily on creating a working gantry, cutting the
								pieces for the box, and crafting a comprehensive Solidworks assembly. Arla has defeated her dad in chess
								a whopping total of three times over the course of her life, an accomplishment she takes great pride in.

							<h3>Computer AI</h3>
							<p>Throughout the duration of the project, our computer chess algorithm learned to check the location of
								chess pieces and to use
								the stepper motor gantry system to make basic chess moves. A pacifist at heart, it currently refuses to
								make captures, but we hope that in the future it learns to make more difficult moves such knights,
								captures, and castles so that it can finally achieve its dream of winning a game.
