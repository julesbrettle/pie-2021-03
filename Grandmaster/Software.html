					<h2>Software Subsystem</h2>

					<p>The Grandmaster Chess Board requires four devices, each with a different program, to be running
						simultaneously.
						Three of these devices (two Arduinos and the Raspberry Pi) have minimal logic and simply serve
						as a digital-physical interface.
						The fourth (a laptop,<a id="to-footnote-1" href="#footnote-1" class="footnote">1</a> termed the
						Game Controller) connects to the other three and is responsible
						for state management and all high-level organization. </p>

					<h4>Arduinos: Board and Gantry</h4>

					<p>
						Two Arduinos are responsible for controlling all electromechanical systems. One controls the
						gantry system, while the other, called the “board” Arduino, controls
						everything else (buttons, lights, and the electromagnet). Both Arduinos communicate with the
						Game Controller over the USB Serial connection.
					</p>
					<p>
						The code for these Arduinos (<a
							href="https://github.com/ariporad/PIE-Grandmaster/blob/main/arduino/board/board.ino">board</a>,
						<a href="https://github.com/ariporad/
									PIE-Grandmaster/blob/main/arduino/gantry/gantry.ino">gantry</a>) is extremely primitive: they receive low
						level commands from the Game Controller (for example, <code>move to square (3, 4)</code>
						or <code>turn on the LED for Button #2</code>) and send a response once that action has been
						completed.
						They also proactively communicate status updates on a regular basis
						(several times per second), which include information like the current position of the gantry or
						the state of all buttons.
					</p>
					<p>
						The communication protocol between the Game Controller and the Arduinos is a bitwise protocol
						with one byte (eight bit) messages. This protocol was adopted over
						a simpler text-based protocol while we were having issues with serial communication (see below),
						with the thinking that it was unlikely for a single byte to be
						partially corrupted. While this wasn't the solution to the issue and we probably could have
						reverted to our older protocol, this one was working well and so wasn't
						worth changing (see the Python-side implementation <a
							href="https://github.com/ariporad/PIE-Grandmaster/blob/b889eea2c4014942ddb13aa759578c0393960424/main/arduino_manager.py">here</a>).
					</p>
					<p>



					<h4>Raspberry Pi</h4>
					<p>
						The Raspberry Pi connects to our overhead camera and transmits images to the Game Controller
						over HTTP and WiFi.<a id="to-footnote-2" href="#footnote-2" class="footnote">2</a> This system
						is far from ideal: the Pi is
						strangely and inconsistently slow, and sometimes disconnects entirely without explanation. It
						usually takes several seconds and often multiple attempts to
						transfer an image.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unfortunately, much debugging has proved fruitless in trying to debug our Raspberry Pi issues.
						In fact, we had originally intended for the Pi to run the Game Controller with no laptop
						present,
						but it proved far too unreliable for this purpose. Most significantly, the Pi wasn't capable of
						reliable Serial communication with the Arduinos, instead taking dozens of seconds to send even a
						one-byte message. When it did send or receive a message, it was usually incomplete or corrupted.
						These issues proved resistant to significant debugging effort, so we were ultimately forced to
						abandon using the Pi as our Game Controller and introduce the laptop. This subsystem would be a
						high priority for modification in a future version of the Grandmaster Chess Board.
					</p>


					<h4>Game Controller</h4>
					<p>The heart and brain of the Grandmaster Chess Board in the Game Controller. The Game Controller is
						written in Python and communicates with both Arduinos and the Raspberry Pi. It is responsible
						for all game logic, including managing the state of the game (human's turn vs. computer's turn
						vs. demonstration mode, etc.), our computer vision system, and the chess algorithm. It also
						provides
						a dashboard and user interface for debugging purposes.
						<br><br> On the Grandmaster Chess Board, the computer's turn begins when the human player moves
						one of their pieces and presses their button. The
						computer begins its turn by using the computer vision system to determine the state of the
						board, then picks its next move with our chess algorithm, and finally uses the gantry system and
						electromagnet to physically execute its chosen move. Once its turn is over, the computer waits
						for the human to move again.

						</div>
						<h4>Computer Vision Pipeline</h4>
						<p>To select its move, Grandmaster first needs to know where the pieces are on the board. It
							does this using a camera mounted over the board. The Game Controller requests an image from
							the Raspberry Pi,
							which activates the camera and corrects for lens distortion using <a
								href="https://opencv.org/">OpenCV</a>,<a id="to-footnote-4" href="#footnote-4"
								class="footnote">4</a> then sends the resulting image back to the Game
							Controller. This image is fed through our
							<a href="https://github.com/ariporad/PIE-Grandmaster/blob/main/main/detector.py">piece
								recognition pipeline</a>,
							which has three steps: board orientation, square calculation, and finally piece detection.
							This process gives us a robust and efficient mechanism to extract piece positions in
							chess-space (that is, <code>knight on C2</code>).
						</p>
						<p>The process starts with board orientation. The Grandmaster Chess Board has an Apriltag<a
								id="to-footnote-5" href="#footnote-5" class="footnote">5</a> in
							each of its four corners. These tags are precisely positioned such that, if the chessboard
							continued for one
							additional square in each direction, they would be in the center of the extra square. This
							positioning allows us to think of the corner <a
								href="https://april.eecs.umich.edu/software/apriltag">Apriltags</a> as being precisely
							nine square-widths apart, which drastically
							simplifies the algorithm.
						</p>
						<p>
							We start the analysis pipeline by using an off-the-shelf Apriltag library<a
								id="to-footnote-6" href="#footnote-6" class="footnote">6</a> to precisely
							locate the center positions of each of the corner tags, and we use that information to
							extrapolate the center position of each square on the chess board.<a id="to-footnote-7"
								href="#footnote-7" class="footnote">7</a>
							Because we compute the center position of each chess square, we are able to establish a
							mapping between image-space (ie. pixels) and chess-space (ie. ranks and files<a
								id="to-footnote-8" href="#footnote-8" class="footnote">8</a>). This is
							vital, because chess algorithms exclusively operate in chess-space.
							Each chess piece also has a unique top-mounted Apriltag, which we find the center of using
							the same library. We then match each piece's Apriltag's location to the closest square
							center location, and assume the piece is on that square.
						</p>
						<p>This system isn't perfect, but it's suitably robust for our purposes. Most notably, we use a
							fish-eye lens to ensure the camera can see the whole board, but it also introduces
							substantial distortion to the image. We're
							able to correct some of this using OpenCV's image correction tools, but not all of it. Most
							significantly, the detected location of an Apriltag on top of a tall piece (ex. a queen) in
							the corner of the board may differ significantly
							from the piece's actual position. We've been able to correct for most of this error by
							adjusting the size of the Apriltags, although future improvements to this system might be
							necessary.</p>

						<h4>Chess Algorithm</h4>
						<p>Once the Game Controller has identified the position of each piece in chess-space, it feeds
							that data into Python Chess. Python Chess is a library which provides a robust
							representation of a chess board and an implementation of the rules of chess.
							Python Chess isn't a chess algorithm though: it can only say what moves you could make, not
							which move you should make. So we use Python Chess to determine all the possible legal moves
							based on the current state of the board, then feed that list
							into our chess algorithm to pick the computer's next move.
						</p>
						<p>
							For this version of the Grandmaster Chess Board, our chess algorithm is fairly primitive: it
							selects moves at random. While this is sufficient for a simple demo, incorporating a more
							robust system would absolutely improve the experience.
						</p>
						<p>
							On the Grandmaster Chess Board, the computer's turn begins when the human player moves one
							of their pieces and presses their button.<a id="to-footnote-3" href="#footnote-3"
								class="footnote">3</a> The
							computer begins its turn by using the computer vision system to determine the state of the
							board, then picks its next move with our chess algorithm, and finally uses the gantry system
							and
							electromagnet to physically execute its chosen move. Once its turn is over, the computer
							waits for the human to move again.</p>
						</p>

						<h4>Move Execution</h4>
						<p>Once the Game Controller has picked its next move, it sends commands to the Arduinos to
							execute that move on the board. For a normal one-piece move, this includes moving the gantry
							to the current location of the piece, engaging the electromagnet,
							moving the gantry to the piece's new location, and disabling the electromagnet. The
							computer's turn is then over, so it updates the board's lights and waits for the human to
							move.
						</p>
						<h4>LED Lights</h4>
						<p>The Game Controller is also responsible for controlling the lights around the outside of the
							board. These lights operate in the following patterns:
						<ul>
							<li><b>Booting Up:</b> rainbow gradient</li>
							<li><b>Ready to Play:</b> pink and blue spiral</li>
							<li><b>White (Human)'s Turn:</b> pink spiral</li>
							<li><b>Black (Computer)'s Turn:</b> blue pulse while "thinking", blue spiral while moving
							</li>
						</ul>
						</p>
						<h4>Debugging Dashboard</h4>
						<p>The Game Controller also runs a dashboard for debugging purposes. This dashboard is entirely
							text-based and runs in the terminal. It consists of logging output from the Game Controller
							and a prompt which allows low-level control of the system
							(moving the gantry, toggling the magnet, setting the LEDs, etc.). It also allows for
							inspection of the computer vision and game logic pipeline. The dashboard is built using <a
								href="https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/python-prompt-toolkit">prompt_toolkit</a>.</p>
