											<header><h2>Summary</h2></header>
											<p>
												The robot is built to look and act similarly to a hermit crab. 
												It has a shell that hides its electronics, and two curved legs 
												to drag itself forward with. If picked up, its head will retreat 
												into the shell until it is put back down. The basic design is built 
												from 2 base plates that hold all the components of the robot. 
												These components sit in snug 3D printed mounts. One plate is 
												mounted to the other at an angle with 3D printed triangular pieces. Two large 
												DC motors drive semicircular aluminum sheet legs, and two caster wheels 
												also support the robot. A servo motor and linkage system can 
												retract the crab's “head” along a slot slider mechanism.

												<p>
													The angled design for the base plates was chosen to optimize space 
													usage and allow the shell to cover a significant amount of the 
													electronics without interfering with the legs. The angled plate 
													also lets the slot slider move at an angle, making it easier 
													to retreat into the shell. The plates were laser cut from 
													Eucaboard, which is strong yet light, to minimize the weight of 
													our robot. The plates are held together and at an angle using 
													two 3D printed triangular mounting blocks. Each block has two 
													screw holes for each plate, and holds the top plate at the 
													ideal 35° angle for the head to be parallel to the ground. 
													The triangles are large since they are the only support for 
													the top plate and hold the robot together.

											<header><h2>Movement</h2></header>
											<p>
												The movement of our robot was inspired by the 
												<a href="https://robots.ieee.org/robots/rhex/" target="_blank">R-Hex robot</a>. 
												We have two curved legs made of sheet metal with added 
												traction to move the robot forward by using the compliance
												in the shape to spring the robot upwards and forwards. We chose
												this over a crawler mechanism because we wanted an organic movement
												(no wheels) but with less motors and higher speed. A crawler
												mechanism of this type would have two legs which each have two motors:
												one for the "hip" joint and one for the "knee" joint. This makes
												the design significantly bulkier and heavier and has more
												room for error. Crawler mechanisms are also often slow because
												of this. With the R-Hex leg design, the robot can be operated off
												of just two motors and they can spin full speed all the way around
												to enable quick motion. The compliance of the legs also means the robot can
												traverse over small obstacles.
											</p>
											<p>
												Because we chose to use only 2 legs instead of 6 like the original
												R-Hex, we also included two caster wheels to stablize
												the movement. Our final motors do not have encoders, so the legs do not move 
												in the ideal way, which is perfectly alternating. This drawback
												resulted from switching to more powerful motors. The wobbly movement 
												is mostly intended, however, to look more like the movement of
												a real hermit crab. The speed of each motor can be adjusted 
												to allow the robot to turn to follow a person with the PIR sensors
												discussed in the <a href="software.html">software</a> and 
												<a href="electrical.html">electrical</a> pages.

											<header><h2>Slot Slider</h2></header>
											<p>
												The head retraction movement of our hermit crab is controlled 
												by a slot slider mechanism. This consists of one head (which 
												acts as a sensor mount), two linkages, and a servo. The head 
												is supported by a “neck” at a 35 degree angle: this way, the 
												sensors are parallel with the ground when mounted on our 
												angled frame. This “neck” allows .1” of clearance in the 
												slot both along the diameter of the neck and the height 
												of the neck. There is also a linkage mount on the back of 
												the head. The linkages and head are 3D printed and the servo 
												mount is laser-cut from Eucaboard. The linkages are connected 
												to each other using screws and locknuts, and one linkage is 
												connected to the servo with the use of a servo horn screwed 
												into the linkage. 
											</p>
											<header><h2>Component Mounts</h2></header>
											<p>
												Component mounts were carefully measured and 3D printed to 
												keep everything secure. We created mounting fixtures for the DC motors,
												9V batteries, aluminum legs, and the servo motor. We also designed the
												base plate with holes for the photoresistor and mounting screws for
												the caster wheels and Arduino Uno. All of the components were carefully
												assembled to have low clearances and pack everything in as tight of a
												package as possible.

											<header><h2>Throwing</h2></header>
											<p>
												One of our original goals was to make our hermit crab durable 
												enough to be thrown without significant damage. Because of time 
												constraints, focusing on different things, and the sheer danger 
												of throwing something so heavy and dense, we decided not to pursue 
												this goal. Some durable shell options we explored were: injection 
												molding a shell shape and lining the shell with composites, foam, 
												or oobleck; creating a shell and covering it with little hooks that 
												would act as springs to dampen impact force; and using vibration 
												resistant washers when connecting anything to the frame of our robot.

											<header><h2>Slot Slider</h2></header>
											<p>
												We began designing the slot slider mechanism in Sprint 2. Originally, 
												the sensors were both facing forward. In the final design, they are 
												120 degrees apart to increase our hermit crab’s range of vision. 
												We also considered designing this mechanism to also move the shell 
												down over the head. We later determined that this was unnecessary. 
												The final design also has a longer linkage connected to the servo 
												(to increase the travel), is more space efficient, and has more 
												clearance between parts (where the original design would interfere 
												with other parts in the assembly).

												Below, the original design is shown in the two left images. The final

												We started testing our hermit crab using motorized car kits
												from a previous mini-project in PIE.
												From here, we had our first taste of how important motor 
												torque would be when speccing motors. The small DC motors
												that came with the kit proved to be too low torque to lift
												the weight of the electronics and other components using
												our compliant legs.

											<header><h2>Sprint 2</h2></header>
											<p>
												In Sprint 2, we introduced the idea of using 2 baseplates to save space, 
												allow the slot slider to slide up into the shell, and potentially allow 
												for protecting more sensitive parts on the top baseplate (assuming they 
												would be the most safe within the shell). When fabricating, we laser-cut 
												what you see to the left. We then drilled holes into the baseplates where we 
												needed them. We had some small problems with the holes not lining up 
												properly, so we made sure to include holes with precise locations when 
												we laser cut our final baseplate structure. In Sprint 2, we also 
												produced the angle between the two base plates with a third wall that 
												held up the end of the angled baseplate. In our final product, we used 
												a triangle with nuts and bolts to hold the angled base plate up. We 
												also added the servo mount. 
											</p>
											<p>
												Our biggest road block in Sprint 2 was discovering that our N20 gearmotors
												did not have enough torque to support our robot's weight. Also, one of the
												two that we bought did not work. Thus, we were not able to get a full system
												up and running until Sprint 3.

											<p>
												Much of our development in Sprint 3 centered around building new
												components to accomodate our new, larger motors. Our first motors
												were very small N20 geared motors, and we switched to much
												larger 12V geared motors.
												The original motor mount design is seen to the upper left, and its
												iteration is shown to the lower left. 
											</p>
											<p>
												In Sprint 2, our leg mounts were two halves, which were press-fit 
												onto the motor shafts. In Sprint 3, we used a set screw to secure 
												the leg mount to the motor, as the D shaft was much less
												pronounced on the new motors. The leg mounts are shown to the right.
											</p>
											<p>
												By the end of Sprint 3, our robot was essentially completely done except
												for some aesthetic pieces like the top hat.
