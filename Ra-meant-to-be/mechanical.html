							<h2>Mechanical Breakdown</h2>
							<p style="margin: 5%; margin-bottom: 0%;">
								The main mechanical components in the project could be broken down into three main
								components: the ramen dispenser, the powder dispenser, and the water dispenser. All
								three work in conjunction with the hot plate and the temperature sensor to make a
								bowl a ramen.

									The mechanical design of the noodle dispenser stayed fairly constant over the course of 
									the development, undergoing one major change from holding a single block of noodles to 
									holding up to eight.

								</p>
								<br>

								<p>
									The main change the mechanical work on the noodle dispenser underwent was in fabrication, 
									as it transitioned from being made of bent and cut sheet metal to being made of hot 
									glued acrylic and MDF. A significant amount of work was put into making the mechanism food 
									safe, as the only fully food-safe material in the design is acrylic, so only acrylic could 
									be in contact with food.
									<br>
									<br>
									The main purpose of the noodle dispenser in this project was to store and dispense the 
									blocks of noodles for the ramen, consistently deploying a single block of ramen into the 
									pot at the correct time. The two main constraints to work around were manufacturing 
									limitations (our original metal didn’t end up being cuttable as we intended or weldable), 
									and food safety. We used a stepper motor and lead screw assembly to drive the motion of 
									all of the blocks into dispensing position, and a servo motor with a mounted acrylic arm 
									to knock a single block of ramen into the pot.
									<br>
									<br>
									The shape of the entire structure was designed around the shape of a block of noodles, as 
									well as the mounting options we had for our frame. The structure was built out of MDF and 
									food-safe acrylic as the main structural components, as well as some small metal and 3D 
									printed pieces for structural integrity and hot glue as an assembly tool. Though loading 
									the blocks of noodles can be difficult, the mechanism consistently works exactly as intended.

								<h3>Powder Dispenser</h3>
								<div class="image" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

								</div>
								<br>
								<p>
									Developing the mechanics of the powder dispenser was a highly iterative process. 
									The first attempts were 3D printed to try and understand the geometry of the mechanism, 
									which was inspired by commercially available protein powder dispensers, with the 
									understanding that we would eventually have to pivot away from 3D printing for food safety. 
								</p>

								<div class="image" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
									<img src="images/powder_dispenser_talk_1.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%;"/>
								</div>
								<br>
								<ol>
									<li>
										Cleanability is important: With the constraints of this project, we couldn’t 
										reasonably stop all ramen powder from leaking out of the system, so it is more 
										important that loose powder is visible and accessible to clean, than hidden away 
										in crevasses in the machine where it could go bad. 
									</li>
									<li>
										Ramen takes more powder than you would think: We learned that we would have to 
										scale up our design to dispense powder on the scale of an entire bowl of soup.
									</li>
								</ol>

								<p>
									These learnings informed the design of our final mechanism, which was designed to 
									be much larger, dispensing 1.8cc of powder at a time, meaning that you needed 3 
									pivots to fill a bowl of soup, rather than the closer to 10 of our original design. 
									<br>
									<br>
									The final mechanism was built out of sheet metal, a 3D printed support for rigidity, 
									an acrylic pivoter, and a Schedule 40 PVC pipe for the hopper. Additionally, vibration 
									motors would agitate the powder in the hopper to make it fall into the pivoter. The 
									mechanism was designed in OnShape.
								</p>

								<div class="image" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
									<img src="images/powder_dispenser_talk_2.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%;"/>
								</div>

								<p>
									The mechanism works fairly well, but major drawbacks include a lack of rigidity in 
									the pivot, and a poor seal between the pivoter and the rest of the components. In 
									future iterations, it would be worth designing a support along the outer edge of 
									the pivoter for rigidity, and exploring more flexible sealants. This design utilized 
									a food grade foam strip, but this did not neatly form a circular seal, leading to 
									openings where powder could leak out. An improvement to be made with more time might 
									be exploring silicone or rubber gaskets that are formed to the geometry of the pieces.

								<h3>Water Dispenser</h3>
								<div class="image" style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">
									<img src="images/water_dispenser.gif" alt="" style="width: 50%;"/>
								</div>
								<p>
									<br>
									The main purpose of the water dispenser in this project was to store enough water for
									about four bowls of ramen and dispense the right amount of water for every bowl. The main constraint
									to work around was making the system food-safe. We used a plumbing valve to control the flow
									of the water. There were iterations made as we went about the process to design the right
									mechanism to connect the servo with the valve itself. In order to save the power and not
									overload the system when the servo didn't have enough torque, we made changes to the rubber stopper 
									instead to lower the initial torque needed. 
									<br>
									<br>
									The design of the connector between the servo and the valve was designed to be in the shape of a
									knob to allow us to manually turn off the system to debug. The connections for the dispenser were 
									created using PVC pipes and plumbing putty to keep the system food-safe. The leaks in the system were 
									caused by the water putty so it didn't adhere to the valve well enough. The angle that caused the 
									valve to be open and the amount of water being dispensed were calibred manually.
