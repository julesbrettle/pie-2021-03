								Our goal was to make the firmware for this project simplistic and efficient. 
								The majority of the firmware can be divided into 3 different sections: The hotplate, 
								Dispensers, and the User Interface.

									The hotplate portion of the firmware includes the on and off switch for the hotplate 
									and the temperature sensor. These two have been mechanically integrated to use servos 
									- so the firmware for this sector is the control of 3 servos. Because we popped the 
									top of the hotplate and pulled out the internal switch PCB of the hotplate to the 
									electrical box, we needed a method to turn on the hotplate on command. The original 
									switches of the hotplate was a capacitive touch sensor, so we approached the issue 
									using a servo to touch the sensor when it was time to turn it on. There were 2 buttons 
									to manage, which led us to program two servos to turn on and touch the sensor 
									separately - there was an issue of the touch sensor not responding, so the servo 
									for the boil sensor was programmed to move twice. (The on servo also acts as an off 
									servo, so this was not pressed twice.) The final function for switching on the servo 
									was outlined as shown below:

									<br>
									The temperature sensor was a little easier than the hotplate servos. The temperature 
									sensing is consisted of two parts - the sensing and the actuator for putting the sensor 
									into the water. Reading the temperature of the sensor was very straightforward. 
									Initialization of the sensor, and reading the values that come thought the allocated 
									digital pin. The servo’s actuation was also very simple. The only setting that we 
									needed to do was to get the starting and ending angles that would let the temperature 
									ensors rest at a reasonable angle when resting, and land in the water when working.
								</p>

								<p>
									The dispenser code was also very servo focused because of the mechanical design. The water 
									dispenser relies on gravity to release water through a simple valve, which was turned by a servo. As with the temperature servo, the program only had to specify 
									which angle was the closing angle and which was the opening angle. The powder dispenser 
									was identical to the water dispenser in terms of setting the starting and ending position, 
									but because of the output of the powder dispenser being smaller than the amount of powder 
									actually needed in a. Bowl of ramen, we implemented a for loop for the servo to turn n 
									times, where n could be edited by the user. Finally, the ramen dispenser was a mix of a 
									stepper motor and servo motor. Because the algorithm for this module was to first push 
									the ramens forward until the limit switch on the front of the module is pressed by the 
									pressure of the noodles, then retreat back a small amount for the relief of pressure, 
									then the actuation of the servo motor to push a single block of ramen out of the module. 
									To do this, We had to figure out that direction spun the stepper motor in what direction, 
									and how much it spun with a given speed. With much experimentation, we found the perfect 
									balance. The code was configured so that while the limit switch is not pushed, the 
									stepper moves forward 500 steps, and then delays for a small interval before moving 
									again. Once the limit switch is pressed, the program exits out of the while loop and 
									retreats the stepper motor, and actuates the servo.

									<span class="image left"><img src="images/team_codin.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									Finally, the user interface was programmed into the machine with relative ease. 
									All we had to do was to implement 2 buttons that would either start the process, 
									or halt the process by turning off the power of the hotplate (hence fittingly 
									named emergency servo) and also display the temperature and time left on the lcd 
									of the machine. The entire integration of the modules discussed above was put into 
									one function. In the loop function, we set up the code so that it reads for the 
									start button and when it reads the button being pressed, it starts the entire process. 
									We also implemented an emergency stop that breaks out of any part of the process and 
									turns off the hotplate. With the buttons implemented, we moved onto how to display 
									things into the lcd. First we created a function for the lcd screen so that we would 
									only have to pass the temperature and time left to the lcd. With this done, we went 
									back to the full integration (run_all()) function. 
								</p>

								<h5>The fully integrated run_all function’s logic is as follows:</h5>
									<ol>
										<li>Turn on power</li>
										<li>Dispense Water</li>
										<li>Dispense Powder</li>
										<li>Lower the temperature sensor</li>
										<li>Turn on the power and boil</li>
										<li>Wait for water to reach 90 C</li>
										<li>Dispense ramen</li>
										<li>Wait 4 minutes</li>
										<li>Turn off power</li>
									</ol>

								<p>
									There are 2 waiting phases in this process. First the program needs to wait 
									for the water to reach 90 degrees, and after it does, it needs to time for 4 minutes. 
									Of course, we needed to update the LCD to display between all this, so during the 
									while loop of waiting for the water to reach 85C, we set the time left as a question 
									mark and for every loop, the temperature would be read again and be updated. After 
									the temperature reaches 85, it would start displaying the time left as well, using a 
									simple timer. we created a very simple delay timer that would decrement the seconds 
									with a delay of 1000ms - and visa versa with the minutes. This would be formatted 
									into string like the temperature and be passed onto the lcd code. Once the timer’s 
									minute variable hit < 0, it halts the entire process and turns off the hotplate.
									<br>
									<br>
									The integration of the multiple modules posed a difficult challenge in terms of 
									when and when not to set the delays. Because the code sometimes starts to run the 
									next in line before finishing one part of the code, delays are very important with 
									servos. Once we figured this out, the rest of the process was smooth sailing. 
									<br>
									<br>
									After the initial MVP of the firmware was achieved, we turned our eyes towards a bigger 
									target. We wanted to make the ramen machine make ramen from another input that was more 
									interesting than a button. We were able to acquire a SIM900 Arduino Shield that allows 
									communication between devices via the cellular network, and we decided that the ramen 
									machine would be triggered by a text message. 
									<br>
									<br>
									The code for the text message function is quite simple. After successfully initialized 
									and letting the module know what type of input it will be accepting, we loop the serial 
									of the module and make it wait for any incoming updates. When there is an update, we take 
									the phone number of the message that has been sent and put it into a variable - which we 
									use later for sending out messages. 
									<br>
									<br>
									However, this code was only tested with the Arduino UNO and not the ramen machine because 
									for some reason, the board caught on fire and the communications chip was burned to ashes. 
									To compensate for this, we searched for alternative methods for remote connection into the 
									ramen machine and decided that we would utilize the ESP8266 Wireless Networking module to 
									run a telegram bot that would receive information on who wanted to make some ramen. 
								</p>

									<img src="images/code_4.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%;"/>
								</div>

								<p>
									<br>
									The code for the Telegram bot is also quite simple. After generating the bot itself 
									using BotFather and getting all the credentials needed to connect to the bot, we set 
									up the module with the UTC time and connect it to the WiFi. The module then waits and 
									listens for new updates from the telegram bot, and when it is received, it passes the 
									information received into an if conditional to check if the person wants ramen, that 
									sends a digital write signal to the start switch of the ramen machine. Due to time 
									constraints, this was never incorporated into the final machine, but would be an 
									interesting extension someone building a new ramen maker.
